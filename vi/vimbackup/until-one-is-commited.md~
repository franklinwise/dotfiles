# Having Doubt?

Doubt kills the warrior spirit. 

> "**Until one is committed, there is hesitancy**, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. 
> Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, *there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans*:
> **that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too**. 
> All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. 
> A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents,
> meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way...
> 
> --W.H. Murray, of the Scottish Himalayan Expedition
